This Julia package contains code to simulate pure and mixed quantum states in photonic mesh lattices. It offers both numerical and symbolic simulation tools for unitary time evolution of arbitrary lattices and allows to compute forward and backward coherence maps between the initial and final state quantum states. The aim is to study photonic mesh lattices as a platform for high-dimensional entanglement.
